# Code Directory

This directory contains all source code organized by functionality.

## Structure

- **data/**: Data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation
- **models/**: Model architectures (baseline, student, compression utilities)
- **training/**: Training loops and utilities
- **evaluation/**: Evaluation metrics and benchmarking

## Implementation Guide

Each module contains template files with:
- Function signatures
- Docstrings explaining what to implement
- TODO comments marking implementation points

Students should:
1. Read the template files
2. Implement the TODO sections
3. Follow the docstrings for expected behavior
4. Add unit tests as needed

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for all functions
- Add comments for complex logic
