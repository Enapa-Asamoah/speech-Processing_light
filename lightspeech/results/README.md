# Results Directory

This directory contains all outputs needed for the technical report.

## Structure

- **models/**: Trained model checkpoints (.pth, .pt files)
- **plots/**: Figures and visualizations (.png, .pdf)
- **tables/**: Performance metrics tables (.csv, .tex)
- **logs/**: Training logs and experiment tracking

## For Technical Report

When writing your technical report, gather materials from:
- `results/plots/` - All figures for the report
- `results/tables/` - Performance comparison tables
- `results/models/` - Model checkpoints for reproducibility

## Organization Tips

- Name files descriptively (e.g., `baseline_vs_compressed_accuracy.png`)
- Include metadata in filenames (model name, dataset, date)
- Keep a log of which plots/tables correspond to which experiments
